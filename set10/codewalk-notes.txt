================

Interfaces, Objects, and Classes

-- class variables should be made private

-- could have avoided doing List.addAll by passing the list as a parameter for constructor of ArrayList

-- could have used HOF filter in readyCount

-- in iterator sorting can be done using a Comparator

-- "equals" method could have been optimized by checking size of the two lists rather than looping through the two lists

-- factory method for Roster object should be in another class, separated from the implementation of the Roster interface

================

Presentation:
